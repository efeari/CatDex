# 🐱 Cat Pokedex

> *"Gotta catch 'em all... but make it cats!"*

Welcome to **Cat Pokedex** - the ultimate platform for cat enthusiasts to discover, catalog, and share their feline encounters! Just like a Pokédex helps trainers track Pokémon, Cat Pokedex helps you document every adorable cat you meet on your adventures.

## 🎯 What is Cat Pokedex?

Cat Pokedex is a web application that transforms cat spotting into an engaging collection game. Whether you're exploring your neighborhood, traveling to new cities, or just hanging out at the local cat café, you can:

- **Discover** cats wherever you go
- **Photograph** and document your findings
- **Catalog** each cat with details like location, personality traits, and memorable moments
- **Track** your collection and see how many unique cats you've encountered
- **Share** your discoveries with fellow cat lovers

Think of it as a combination of Pokémon GO, iNaturalist, and Instagram, but exclusively for our feline friends! 🐾
